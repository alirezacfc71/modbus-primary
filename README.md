# Simple Modbus Master-Slave Simulation

This project simulates a basic Modbus TCP communication between one Master and multiple Slave devices. It is useful for educational purposes and testing Modbus-based control systems without physical hardware.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Modbus TCP communication using `pymodbus`
- Simulated Slave devices with configurable registers (temperature values)
- Master polls data from Slaves at regular intervals
- Easy to extend for writing to registers or adding control logic
